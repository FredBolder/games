            testament to what we have learned not only from DCI (Digital Career
            Institute GmbH), but also from each other and with that embarking on
            the journey of self-discovery, continuous learning and improvement
            that is programming.

            As of Jan. 17, 2024, Fred Bolder is working on this site. The
            styling of the whole site is improved. The game Tennis is now also
            playable on a phone or a tablet. There are a lot of new levels added
            to the game Bal. New in the game Bal are swimming, red fish,
            electricity, trap doors and a button to skip a level, in case it is
            too difficult.

            Tennis (mainly programmed by Donnie) is inspired by the arcade video
            game Pong.
